Ferris Wheel
============

A fantastic spreadsheet framework!

To run the example
------------------

    mvn install -Dgpg.skip -DskipTests && mvn spring-boot:run -pl example

Then open your browser (Chrome is recommended) and navigate to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/

If 8080 port is taken, you have to configure spring boot to run on another port before you build this project.
